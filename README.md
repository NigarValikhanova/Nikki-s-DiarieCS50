# Nikki-s-DiarieCS50
NikkiDiarieCS50 is my final project for Harvard's CS50 course, designed as a web-based diary application where users can securely register, log in, and create diary entries. This project incorporates key concepts learned throughout the course, such as web development, databases, and user authentication.
